- A request to your server should never hang forever
- You need at least GET, POST, and DELETE methods.
- Locations:
    - Turn on or off directory listing.
    - Set a default file to answer if the request is a directory.
    - Execute CGI based on certain file extension (for example .php).
    - Make it work with POST and GET methods.
